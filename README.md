Just a fun project I did to try Text To Speech feature on Mac along with Google's Speech to Text library.

Dependency:
User need to install following python packages-
- SpeechRecognition 3.6.5 (hint: Use Pip to install it)
- PyAudio 0.2.9 (hint: use Brew to install it)

Note: This script is specific to Mac due to usage of 'say' command.
